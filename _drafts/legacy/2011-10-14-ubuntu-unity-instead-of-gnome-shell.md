<p>Canonical Ltd was created specifically to usher Ubuntu operating system. As some of you may know, linux operating systems offer different desktop environments you can choose from (KDE, XCFE, GNOME ect..) Ubuntu in itself was built on GNOME, there are other versions of ubuntu such as Kubuntu, or Xubuntu, that leverage the previously mentioned desktops Shells. </p>
<p> Ubuntu until its 11.04 release Natty Narwhal, has been based on GNOME and heavily relied on Gnome UI for its desktop interface. Gnome evolved and recently released their newest desktop shell called<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell"> Gnome-shell</a>, based on GNOME3 the most current Gnome exploitation. This upgrade heavily focuses on a smoother user interface, an easier access of files and a better multitasking environment. </p>
<p> Canonical obviously wanted to take a different approach, and took the controversial decision to develop their own desktop shell they called <a href="http://www.techronicles.net/2011/10/ubuntu-unity-roundup.html">unity</a>. Canonical is sponsoring an open-source project, but made clear several time that<a href="http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/03/19/mark-shuttleworth-clarifies-ubuntu-is-not-a-democracy/"> ubuntu, isn't a democracy</a>.  Some may argue this decision was logical, Gnome-shell will not support touch capable devices, second it will require a 3D acceleration, third, Gnome-Shell's branding is heavily in conflict with Ubuntu's branding. Other linux operating systems such as <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Gnome3">fedora</a> will ship with Gnome-Shell by default. </p>
<p> Canonical however will also support Gnome-Shell. To install Gnome-Shell in Ubuntu 11.10, run the simple command</p>
<p> sudo apt-get install gnome-shell</p>
<p> The differences with the desktop environments are purely cosmetic. Here's another blogger's test of <a href="http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/09/gnome-shell-in-ubuntu-1110-first.html">Gnome-Shell</a>. I've already started focusing on unity and will continue doing so in my blog. Gnome-Shell is really tempting, but I want to move away from the ete candies and diversify my posts. </p>
