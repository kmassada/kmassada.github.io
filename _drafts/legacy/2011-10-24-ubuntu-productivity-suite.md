<p>I have not had time because of the new Job I have, But let me just quickly update this in a simplistic manner, at least the information will be there for now. </p>
<p><b>Office:</b></p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office:</a> This now comes pre-installed with Ubuntu. To be honest I don't use it, instead I use Google Docs online. I don't get the polish of a real office suite, but it helps me keep everything that I do very minimalistic and simple.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">Xournal:</a> It is an application for note taking and annotation. Ubuntu by default will let you print anything to PDF (file&gt;print&gt;print to file). So when I get my slides for class, I print them out to pdfs, 4 per page. then I use Xournal to write notes on them. I then save them to pdfs again, or most of the time keep it in Xournal format.

<p><b>Terminal: </b></p>
<p>-<a href="https://launchpad.net/byobu">Byobu:</a> It is a terminal with a lot of functions, it is very useful when you are doing things that need monitoring. For example, with the command "atop" you need a new tab. You can argue why not use terminator or gnome default terminal. Well byobu has a lot of things in built like system notifications. But I really fell in love with it because it can run on servers with no GUI.</p>
<p><b> Search and Launcher:</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />-<a href="https://launchpad.net/~synapse-core/+archive/ppa">Synapse:</a> once upon a time I loved docks, you could see in some of my older posts that I used a lot of those to pre-load all the most used apps. But it came to a point where I didn't have a consistant number of most used apps. Synapse is a launcher that with the command ctrl-space which i changed to win-space because ctrl space is useful in eclipse. It comes on and off on demand, it can look through files and apps and launch them. It does cool things like custom ssh sessions. The video below shows more what it can do.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<p>-<a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/catfish-file-search-tool-that-support-several-different-engines.html">Catfish:</a> I use catfish for ubuntu, for more advanced search, example system logs etc...</p>
<p>--On a final note, I really avoid to have tremendous setups for my machine because I've not been able to come up with a satisfying way to do backups. Anything I can do with chrome I do so it follows me everywhere.</p>
<p>quick example with banshee they have this playlist editing bug, after all the ratings and playlisting, the fix is to delete a db file and let banshee rewrite it, the rest of the settings are not backed up at the same locations. Every backup app will back up the whole env, or folder, it's also because ubuntu has scattered way of saving preferences, some apps will even save some configs in /opt/.</p>
