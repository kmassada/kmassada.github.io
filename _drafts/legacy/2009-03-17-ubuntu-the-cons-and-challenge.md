<p>1- Do not wake up one day and just switch. Research is very crucial. Like I have mentioned in my previous post, ubuntu initially came out in 2004. This OS is still young, and although all its good stuff, it doesn't have the stability of MAC, or Windows. Here are few things I recommend.
<ul>
<li>check <a href="http://www.linuxcompatible.org/compatlist3.html">Linux Compatible </a> to see if all your hardware will work if you decide to switch.</li>
<p>
<li>never switch completely until you become a master at Ubuntu</li>
<p>
<li>look into<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/"> virtual box</a>, to virtually install ubuntu, and learn their ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>2- If you are a Gamer, DO NOT INSTALL UBUNTU... Ubuntu might be fast, and Linux might have its own set of games, but most games are made for PC aka Windows. Even MAC users sometimes fight to get games on their OS.</p>
<p>3- Do Not Install if you are not willing to learn. Everything you will do in Ubnutu is an Adventure. If you are not willing to search the community for solutions, then Do Not Even Think About Installing Ubuntu.</p>
<p>4- Be ready for a Challenge. Ubuntu is nice and easy, depending on what you want to do, and might be tedious in other cases. Be ready to constantly be challenged.</p>
