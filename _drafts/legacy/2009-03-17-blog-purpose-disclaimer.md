<p>I created this blog originally because after switching to ubuntu there has been a tremendous amount of work i did on my computer to setup my Ubuntu to a comfortable level. To avoid reinventing the wheel every time, I decided to log all that I have done, before I forget how I did it.</p>
<p>I do not and will not pretend to be some almighty Ubuntu Guru. I am just an undergrad learning and having fun with ubuntu.  I actually still consider myself as a novice. This blog is a recollection, of solution I discovered on my own, or by searching the net, and of general tips and advices on how I did setup my machine.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I will not bear or endorse any responsibility for any damages that might occur while you follow advices that are posted on this blog. This blog is a personal notebook. Its content could be viewed and applied, but it is at each user's risk and peril.</p>
<p>(9/31/2011) I decided to now broaden my blog's spectrum to different tech topics and not just limit it to ubuntu. It is still my main OS, therefore there will still be a lot of posts about it, but its no more the main focus of this blog.</p>
