<p>I've always wanted to be on my computer, do work and receive my SMS live on my machine, respond on my computer and then move on. Google voice offers you a <a href="http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/port-your-existing-mobile-number-to.html">painful solution</a>, where for $20 you drop your number completely switch it to Google voice, and then text online. You also have a zillion of services that let you text online, but none of them use your carrier number.</p>
<p>The solution is <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.desktopsms">DeskSMS</a>. By using the power of push notifications through your GMail account, this app for $5 a year will allow you to send SMS and receive SMS on your machine. It has extensions for your favorite browsers (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/desksms/">Firefox</a>/<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmgcfdmgcfldfkehdgoancleciikdlnf">Chrome</a>), it also leverages chrome desktop notifications, and can let you setup your SMS on IM clients like Pidgin, Empathy, Trillian etc.</p>
<p>I know some of you would be perplex to have your SMS travel through the cloud like that, but I don't mind. Your messages as a matter of fact are stored in your GMail and nowhere else. The creator of the app is <a href="http://www.koushikdutta.com/">Koushik Dutta </a> this is the same guy that <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110322/01324413579/top-hacker-rejects-job-offer-sony-over-ps3-jailbreak-legal-strategy.shtml">rejected a job offer from sony</a> because of the way they handled a fellow colleague. That gives me enough hint of values and ethics. I also don't mind trusting Google with my SMS, hell we already do trust them with our chat, and our credit cards for those of us that use Google checkout.</p>
