<p>AllTray is a program you can use               on <span class="sc">Unix</span>-like systems such as               GNU/Linux or <span class="sc">FreeBSD</span> running the X               Window System to dock any application which doesn’t have a               native tray icon into the system tray/notification area.               AllTray works with many desktop environments and window               managers, including               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity" title="Wikipedia: Metacity">Metacity</a> on <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> and               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin" title="Wikipedia: KWin">KWin</a> on <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>.  The current               release of AllTray is 0.7.2dev, and can be               downloaded <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/alltray/+download" title="Launchpad: AllTray project files">from               Launchpad</a>; the most recent stable release is 0.70               and is also available at that location.  For more on               AllTray’s history and current development plans, please               see the <a href="http://alltray.trausch.us/about.html">About</a> page.</p>
<p><span style="color:#073763;">All Tray too isn't included in Unity (after Natty Narwhal). </span></p>
