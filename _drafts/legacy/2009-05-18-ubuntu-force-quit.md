<p>Force quit usually comes by default in Gnome, and you could add it, like you would add anything to the Gnome panel. I found it very useful, since i am always using some BETA of a software, and sometimes, I need to force quit those apps.<br /><span style="color:#073763;"><br /></span><br /><span style="color:#073763;">Since the introduction of Unity interface, Force Quit don't exist anymore.. a simple workaround is to go into system monitor, go to processes and end process. the only challenge is, some processes are hard to find, they either have the name 'sh' 'bash' or 'python' but usually if you need to force quit an app, its most likely the one hogging CPU and RAM usage.Â </span></p>
