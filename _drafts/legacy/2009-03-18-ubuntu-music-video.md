<p><strong>Restricted Extras: </strong><br />
<blockquote>The Ubuntu Restricted Extras will install Adobe Flash Player, Java Runtime Environment (JRE) (sun-java-jre) with Firefox plug-ins (icedtea), a set of Microsoft Fonts (msttcorefonts), multimedia codecs (w32codecs or w64codecs), mp3-cRestricted Extras: ompatible encoding (lame), FFMpeg, extra Gstreamer codecs, the package for DVD decoding (libdvdread3, but see below for info on libdvdcss2), and the unrar archiver. This is a single command approach.</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>VLC</strong><br />Since I had windows, I love VLC player so I always install it no matter what<br />
<blockquote>sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-vlc</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><br />Frostwire</strong></p>
<p>There are thousands of utilities out there that you can use to download peer to peer music. one of them is frostwire. You can google it, and download it, its installation package is .deb, its pretty straight forward.</p>
<p><strong><br />Amarok</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> is the default kde music player, it is pretty handy, and probably is the best music player that runs on ubuntu. There are also other players like <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">banshee</a>, <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/">rythmnbox</a>, but unanimously, amarok since to the favorite among ubuntu users.</p>
<p><strong>SoundConverter</strong></p>
<p>very powerfull converter, could convert almost any media you could think off.</p>
<p><strong>Miro</strong></p>
<p>very interesting webcast viewer. Check it out and try it.</p>
<p><strong>XMBC</strong></p>
<p>Acts like a media cataloger, or suite, very appealing GUI, I don't find it functional because its not very helpful due to the way i have my files organized on my pc, but definitely interesting concept.</p>
