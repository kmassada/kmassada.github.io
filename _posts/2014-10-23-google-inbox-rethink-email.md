<p>There has been a lot of noise made around Google inbox? What is it? It's a task focused inbox.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzNTjpUMOp4</p>
<p>If you have made it through the video you probably know as much about inbox as I do.</p>
<p>Before inbox, I used <a href="https://ifttt.com/">ifttt.com</a>. IFTTT is a service that allows you to generate events based on actions in various accounts. For this specific example, IFTTT would create a calendar event, which happens to be in my <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/106237?hl=en">task-calendar</a>, every time I stared an email.</p>

<p>As you can see this process is tedious, and you can imagine the many things that don't work with this approach. you can't select a custom date, the calendar-task is set for the next day, starting from the time you starred it. and so on.</p>
<p>Inbox to the rescue. Inbox allows you to "pin" items, set reminders, so that your emails turn into project or tasks to be completed. Instead of repeating what everyone has covered, (will add a review video to the end of post by someone else). Allow me to talk about what works, and doesn't work too well. For a 1st release, I'll try not to be too harsh.</p>
<p>1st, the categories work like a charm and are well thought of, you might recognize some from your Gmail.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414117508362" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414117508362.png" alt="image" width="300" height="534" /></p>
<p>On the left is a reservation I made sometime this year (travel), and at the right is an album i bought (purchases)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414117496423" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414117496423.png" alt="image" width="286" height="508" />    <img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414117501322" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414117501322.png" alt="image" width="286" height="509" /></p>
<p>As advertised, the feature of turning your email into a task list works so well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414117491240" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414117491240.png" alt="image" width="280" height="498" /></p>
<p>One thing missing in my opinion is a label for personal communications. Email from friends or close family members aren't always items you want to act upon, but just like in gmail, that group doesn't get much love. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to think of emails from my mom and sister as social.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414116567938" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414116567938.png" alt="image" width="303" height="539" /></p>
<p>also at this point in the testing, any "snooze" I set doesn't show up in Google now. Or calendar. It is a personal preference and one can debate pros and cons to having a feature like this. Nevertheless I feel it should be offered as an option. Google Now however already does a great job to curate "important" items that can be added like cards to your feed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all done items, are everything else in your inbox, and not just items you pined and completed.</p>
<p><a href="http://techronilces.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpid-wp-1414120600356.png"><img class="alignnone " title="wp-1414120600356" src="/images/wp/wpid-wp-1414120600356.png" alt="image" width="295" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>It will be nice to keep the consistent category colors, for pins, so you can quickly mind map what pin is for what category/bundles like google call. it.<br />
