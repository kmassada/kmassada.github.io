title: "A covid story and finding a passion"
excerpt: "This is the story of wrestling with the meaning of all through the pandemic, finding a passion, feeling shame to share the passion, finding pride in what you do, even if it doesn't save the world, being proud of yourself, and a rare occasion to tell my story."

I don’t think I was alone to have felt this shell shock when I realized the world was about to take a huge time out due to this deadly thing that seemed to roam our streets, from country to country with no end in sight. I also know I've not been alone in questioning everything: "what's the point of this whole thing"?

There were a few instances prior to the beginning of the shutdown that seeded the question in my mind, but it started to take deeper roots as the spring bloomed. I've been mulling for a while, finding the balance between what I do for a living and what can I do in my community?

That question is why I've always taken advantage of my google badge, at times traveling to Africa to teach computer science ([volunteering at WiSci](http://blog.kmassada.com/volunteering-wisci-17/)), or working locally to host several organizations who focus on access to STEM for underrepresented groups, or volunteered in Google's summer of computer science program. 

That urge to want to contribute and uplift others also led to my current role of SME/Mentor. Yup! You heard it right! A sizable amount of what I do today is spent mentoring individuals but with the eyes set on scaling the experience I’ve acquired through my journey in our ranks.

I must also be honest and say these questions although born out of curiosity also bear a painful truth, I struggled a lot through the pandemic, like many. I say this understanding my struggles were not pegged to my survival. I’m thankful to have been in a field that has not experienced the pandemic in the same way others did.

Feeling useful to my community, feeling connected to my peers, my world as I've known it, fed my professional work. A typical day on campus was a true energy pill. I said hi to everyone, especially the folks I felt deeply indebted to, the staff on the campuses. I made a point to go find teammates wherever they were hiding. By the time I got to my desk I was locked in, ready to work with a lot to prove. I also got inspired by visiting other campuses and feeding off my team's energy. I was well on the verge of 21 visited offices before the pandemic.

The loss of most of my day to day inspiration coupled with some personal challenges made this period even more difficult. In this mirage I lost a dear friend to suicide. The impact of this left a hole in my soul. There are a few more episodes in my life that have left me stunned, and as open and vulnerable I consider myself to be, and as outspoken as I am, I’m still unraveling each thread, I barely know what it feels like, let alone have the words.

The radio silence of life and the many days spent alone helped me understand what gets me through the day and what gets me through the quarter. I realized a lot of my productive fulfillment in its most basic form meant regardless of what I engage in, I must feel it must matter, it must make me feel like I'm contributing something useful, it must be interesting, but also it must make me feel full, glistening from within, and it must give me a sense of at least impacting someone else.

Work as I’ve known it, made me feel super helpful, but there's another level of wings you grow when a kid you mentored is getting accepted to a prestigious computer science program, or one of your prodigy is now a sack of an engineer at a big tech firm. I understand this is different for everyone, but things like this overjoy me.

There’s a new element that didn't used to weigh so much in how I pursued opportunities. It was amazing to volunteer for things, but was I the right one for the job? It does indeed feel good to help out but "what’s your gift?" and "What is it in you that you have to bring to the world?" 

The creator of Khan Academy, Sal Khan and the comedian Hasan Minhaj, host of the Patriot Act discussed some of the same back-and-forth I had in mind in an amazing 30 min interview ([Hasan Minhaj on finding your gifts, being authentic, & understanding yourself | Homeroom with Sal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm0Y3ym-JUg).
This episode was healing, because it addressed the same challenges in South East Asian cultures, similar to African cultures; our parents wanted us to all be doctors, lawyers and engineers and nothing else. I jokingly affirmed to my father that I shall return home with 2 PhDs, every-now and then I still wake up in a cold sweat stressed about getting started on the first. The imposter syndrome is real especially when your sister is the fearless [Dr Karen Massada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-massada-md-693b97119).

The message in that interview opened a new thread in my mind about exploring gifts, at the same time gave me comfort knowing it's okay if what I pursue doesn’t end world hunger. It’s okay if my best known secret talent is curating music. I have a playlist for everything. I found a lot of comfort in the mantra of finding things that come easy to you, and contributing that to the world, even if that's not a scientific contribution to the development of a covid vaccine, like [Dr Onyema Ogbuagu](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/coronavirus/vaccine-studied-at-yale-reaches-new-milestone-as-connecticut-hits-100k-cases-of-covid/2367241/).

Now that I identified something had to give, I needed to make a firm hypothesis into finding that gap filler. I decided to launch a crafty project that'll have nothing to do with Tech.... so I thought at the moment. I looked and searched, at first it was gardening. I wasn't particularly good at it, I successfully managed to kill a succulent.

Then on a long drive, heading out to camp on the oregon coast, my good friend had the idea of starting a podcast... I named it "Things we don't say Podcast", TWDS Podcast [twdspodcast.com](https://twdspodcast.com). It seemed to have all the aspects of the components I wanted, it was creative and didn't have to do with tech? Right? It bridged the human connection I needed and it brought me closer to the community, and it also brought stories, entertainment, lessons to the world.

I launched the project under the disguise of fun conversations with friends that pan all types of topics: Religion, Spirituality, Growth, Geopolitical Economics, Love... Remember the hidden passion for curating music, I found a way to include it by reaching out to up and coming artists to let me feature their music on my show.

I've debated sharing this in my Professional Networks since a lot of the original conversations revolved around "the person" and not "the techie/professional". But I must also admit, I tried to subtly mention it earlier but I felt a bit of shame around the project, because of the erroneous thinking I've harvested growing up, I’ve convinced myself certain things hold a different value than others. I’ve also convinced myself that my value and contribution to the world didn’t matter unless it was being a doctor, engineer, lawyer or saved the world. 

However, there's a tremendous amount of rigor that has gone into bringing this to life, and I know a lot of peers/mentors will be proud of the journey. Most importantly I’ve learned to be proud of my journey. I hope my future self can read this and find comfort in it, because I know I’m not done unlearning this.

Before this Post gets too long I must talk a bit about the "black story". Relax I’m not about to make you uncomfortable talking about race, okay maybe, just a little, but it's mostly about every group that currently feels they don't have a voice. 

As a people, African American, African, Afro-Carribean, Afro indigenous, it is primordial that we tell our stories today because we have a lot of missing pieces throughout history. In an episode, my friend Raymond made a pertinent remark, we are making history today. Although the assiduous task of recovering our history is important, it's even better serving that we don’t allow history to repeat itself. This is why you’ll see a lot of the stories on my platform have the voices and faces you aren’t used to hearing from.

Okay, wait a minute, you thought I was finished? (If there's a [melody](https://youtu.be/otwGb-S0txk?t=95) that comes to your head after I've made that millennial dad joke, kudos to you! "[Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8q8PXoJwVk)" in John Oliver's voice). The hilarious part about this project is, it quickly turned technical..

I’m currently working on being my own podcast platform host because I know a thing or two about distributed systems in the cloud. In the process I built a distributed site on GCP, using let's encrypt for auto renewing my certs, debated traefik vs nginx proxy, using facebook developer tools to detect actions and act on them, and built a website analytics pipeline to understand my listenership.

I've also picked up some unusual skills, some Adobe creative suite skills in the mix because that's what the cool kids do. But more importantly I now understand why so many of my dear co-workers are all audiophiles. Sound engineering is the most geeky thing I could do. De-ess, de-verb, gain translate to UFS, compress, normalize, all had to happen before I could deliver a clip. 

The business aspect is also a fascinating aspect. I now get a tiny more understanding about branding, impressions, click through rate, downloads vs listenership, understanding and growing your audience, and even a tad bit of marketing. I think it’ll be noteworthy to someday talk about all the hats I’ve held at this point in time to bring to you my first season. 

You know that inertia from throwing an object you expect to go far, but just watching it fall a few feet at best! That's what I feel. However I'm super excited I lounged, put my hips into it and let loose. I'm really excited because it's the first step I ever took out of my trade, so may we toast to many more. Maybe after this season no other episode will see the day, but I’m happy to take the mental note of the courage it took to be out of the comfort zone. 

Hope you've enjoyed this read.
