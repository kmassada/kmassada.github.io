<p>I started this blog way back, when Ubuntu's interface comprised just simple panels, and a very customizable interface. Since 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) Ubuntu has switched its interface to <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">UNITY</a> an interface concentrated around the Ubuntu Main Menu, as illustrated bellow.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://techronilces.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/506f6-screenshotat2011-10-0205253a12253a59.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="assets/506f6-screenshotat2011-10-0205253a12253a59.png?w=300" width="640" /></a></div>
<p>The Panel is now more rigid, and leaves room for no addition. you still have your system notifications, and for apps that can handle it, such as<a href="https://launchpad.net/weather-indicator"> Weather indicator</a>. But instead you have additions such as the sound menu that allows you to control your media (below left) without having to open it, or messaging menu that controls your chat messages (below right) and others. 
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://techronilces.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/3149f-menu_002.png" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="assets/3149f-menu_002.png" /></a><a href="http://techronilces.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/badf8-menu_003.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="assets/badf8-menu_003.png?w=135" width="144" /></a></div>
<p>Ubuntu also got rid of synaptic package manager, and replaced it by their own <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/features/ubuntu-software-centre">Ubuntu Software Center</a></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://techronilces.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/9f1e9-workspace1_008.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="assets/9f1e9-workspace1_008.png?w=300" width="640" /></a></div>
<p>There are other changes, if relevant that I will be covering in the near future such as Ubuntu One, or some less interesting like Ubuntu One Music Store. Ubuntu is trying to be more appealing to the masses, without loosing it's core base of programmers, and fanatic command line warriors. That being said there is still the option to disable unity and install the default desktop, but not sure how long that option will be available.</p>
<p>Although the appearance is very appealing, Ubuntu still has it main issue: support of proprietary software. It is a lot to ask from an open-source operating system to support Skype, Flash, or banal things like the new Facebook Chat or Facebook Spotify Open Graph actions like it is on other OS. But for the everyday user those are essential tools.</p>
<p>Ubuntu However is still strong, ext4 has been a major improvement on hard drive speed and transfer of data. Booting time is the shortest ever, even with a lot of startup apps, your machine will boot in a comfortable 10 secs max, pushing 7 with the newer hardware. Command line still gold, and a lot of more comprehensive changes, like Nautilus (Ubuntu files and folder manager) that is faster with search and more user friendly.</p>
<p>Overall for what I do, i'm satisfied, I get my Eclipse to work beautifully as ever, my command line stays truthful to ssh into school server and files. My browser now chromium (open source version of chrome)   even in alpha still is way better and stable than IE9. It is true it is very frustrating when my Skype crashes (let's also mention that i'm on the Beta version of the next release), or when I can't just click an app and automatically have it launch. Or I can't play with OovoO without much tweaking, but overall, i'm concerned by speed and efficiency and that I get. to prove my satisfaction, here is my hard drive partition for OSes. Ubuntu and nothing else.
