<p><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/goog_423335"></a>Overview: Ever heard of complaints about Microsoft Vista being slow as hell? Ever had thoughts of switching operating systems. Ever had a thoughts of adopting linux? I have found my answer to those questions in UBUNTU(translation for humanity to others). Ubuntu is a Linux based operating system that came around in 2004. Since it's original release Ubuntu had at least several releases already.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#993300;">Reasons for switching</strong><span style="color:#993300;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><em>1- Need for Innovations, and NEW!</em></span><br />As a computer engineering major, I was desperate of something new and classy, I was desperate of something that would differ from windows and allow me a the freedom to dominate and control my OS.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><em>2- Need for something Free (with no asterisk)</em></span><br />Ubuntu, like most linux distributions is an open source meaning completely free. I needed something that would cost nothing at all.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><em>3- Eager to learn</em></span><br />I was eager to explore, and started a "crusade of knowledge" (one of my fetish clauses). I wanted to learn.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:navy;">Why Ubuntu Specifically:</span> </strong>Someone on one of the blogs I read often told me that I could have acquired the same experience in any linux distribution. so Why Ubuntu?</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;"><em>a- THE COMMUNITY</em></span><br />right before starting the process of learning Ubuntu I was facing a little challenge. I wanted to know how I could get help when needed? After going through tons of websites, I realized one thing. Ubuntu has the biggest support community with thousands of posts that meet ur needs.</p>
<p><em><span style="color:navy;">b- THE INTERFACE / SPEED</span></em><br />before choosing ubuntu, i also looked at Fedora, OpenSuse, PcLinusOS, and Kubuntu. There are different development environments, or if you like, looks for linux. 2 of the most popular ones are: kde and gnome(ubuntu runs on gnome). To be honnest Kubuntu has been my favourite choice, but unfortunately kde is bulky, and a little bit slow for me. It looked so appealing with its crazy plasma themes, but i needed something fast and efficient. I loved also both OpenSuse and Fedora, but couldn't find enough support for my system.</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;"><em>c-THE BEST</em></span><br />before installing linux, i did my research, and i wanted to know, which linux OS exactly was the most userfriendly, and easy to manipulate, and the answer overwhelmingly was Ubuntu.<span id="goog_423338"></span><span id="goog_423339"></span><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/"></a></p>
