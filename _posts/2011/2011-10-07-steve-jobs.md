<p>If you by now don't have a clue of who this guy is, you leaving under a rock. I've personally never been a fan of some of his practices, but it definitely doesn't take away the fact that he was undeniably one of the most talented, hands on and technical CEOs of our times. Without him personal computers will be way behind, without his vision, there'll probably never have been an Android Platform. Few words to pay tribute to a Great Man and a Great Leader.</p>
